# audit
This is the code I've put together for auditing our systems. 
This code includes config files and cron jobs(rkhunter/chkrootkit) as well as a script that adds Auditing of user TTY and root commands with auditd on Ubuntu.
(There are two host files one thats from the /etc/ansible and then one from the /etc)
